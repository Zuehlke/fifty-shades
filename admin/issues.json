    "body": "Programming is becoming more and more in primary schools. This initiative is recognized all around the world - many kids are being taught programming.\r\n\r\nStop! We're wrong! Do not teach children programming!\r\n\r\nThe assumption is wrong. What we are doing is observing the present and we notice the rising trend of the need for developers. We extrapolate this fact and base the future on it, with the conclusion that the same rules will apply in 10 or 20 years from now; when our children are going to be old enough to work.\r\n\r\nIf there is something we do not know, that is the future of the world as it is now. The dynamics of the change in the digital industry is so big that there is no pattern which can be applied to it. The amount of information is being multiplied; requirements change faster than ever. The truth is, we have no idea how the world will look in 20 years. In such an environment, programming, unfortunately, is not a \"joker\" wildcard that will give the heirs a chance to master the future world.\r\n\r\nMoreover, programming IT market is looking for is mercilessly monotonous and stumbling. It's all about the skill; programming today is reduced to the framework timing, and less to the science. Do we really want to include children in such anemic world of programming?\r\n\r\nProgramming should not have a meaning in itself. Programming should become a tool - in fact, only one of the tools that will be available to people. The technical knowledge, which we boast of and so passionately wish to put into young brains, should not be taken as the primary source of knowledge.\r\n\r\nInstead, we need to teach children _critical thinking_. In a world without censorship, but with false news, a critical attitude is more important than programming patterns.\r\n\r\nWe need to teach children _communication_. A world in which everyone has a voice and an opinion about everything requires a precise and clear communication and exchange of ideas and thoughts.\r\n\r\nWe have to teach children to _work together_. In a world where there are more screens than people, cooperation becomes a necessary ingredient of progress.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, we have to teach the children _creativity_. Creativity is a part of the human definition. Creativity is something we need to constantly stimulate, now more than ever before, because that is the only way our children will discover new ways how the tomorrow will be functioning.\r\n\r\nDo not teach children programming. Teach them that they can and should change their present - that is going to be our future."

    "body": "# Never Forget\r\n\r\nWe code software. Every day, every hour; an endless stream of code gets written and merged into the products. The human's codebase is _massive_. Space Shuttle is working with 400K lines of codes. Large Hadron Collider takes 50 million lines. And all Google services combined work on 2 billion code lines.\r\n\r\nThe software runs technology. Tech becomes omnipresent in our lives; from pocket devices to augmented reality and the intelligence. The impact that technology is making on human lives is undeniable and inevitable. This fact has its burden: is the technology growing in the right direction?\r\n\r\nThe answer to that question echoes from the past: it can be found in the thoughts of the first computer engineers and among the ides of the first technology visionaries. They all state the very same message: the purpose of technology is not about having everyone interacting online all the time; tech is not a ubiquitous substitution-pill (hard) to swallow.\r\n\r\nTechnology is the _challenge_ for humankind to evolve. It's an opportunity to dramatically increase the collective knowledge to address the most challenging problems. It is a call to action for public and private sectors to recognize the exponential growth of humankind's challenges, and to provide the vigorous, proactive, strategic pursuit of meaningful evolution.\r\n\r\nWe, the developers, are makers, creators. We are given the tools and the power of producing the code that will shape the future. We must come with disruptive ideas that will lead to organizational and societal transformations. Such attitude should be part of the DNA of any software company; that shapes the products, services and the work. We are here not to code, but to answer the challenges.\r\n\r\nHello world, never forget to keep evolving."

Don't follow them, but challenge them instead; make your own list.\r\n\r\n+ **Refactor a lot.** Don't refrain just because the current code works. Development is not about writing the code, it's about refactoring so it becomes more understandable to the human readers, not computers. \r\n+ **Naming is a king.** Invest time in good names. Like, `reallyGoodNames()`.\r\n+ **Libraries over frameworks.** Each framework captures you within its own boundaries. That's neither good or bad, it's just how it is. However, most of the time the framework can be replaced with simple(r) libraries that conceptually do the same, and leave more freedom for leaner architecture.\r\n+ **Composition over Inheritance**. Inheritance is one very strong connection. While some languages (like Java) almost forces usage of inheritance, use it occasionally. \r\n+ **Short, but many**. Write shorter code, but allow many classes and methods to exist. It's better to have more types, then the single god-class.\r\n+ **Document decisions**. Write down why some architecture, tool or pattern is not been used or chosen. Write down also why some solution is chosen.\r\n+ **Benchmarks as a proof of an optimization**. Do not optimize for speed unless you have a benchmark that defines a bottleneck.\r\n+ **Establish boundaries**. Build modules with single purpose. Define communication channels: API, interfaces. Make loosely coupled components. Control the side-effect by minimizing them.\r\n+ **Developer first tooling**. Optimize your environment as much as possible. Automate. Automate more. Developers should develop. Don't waste their time on trivial tasks. Infrastructure should run out of the box.\r\n+ **Generalization vs Specification** - find the sweet spot between generalization and specification. Generalization is abstraction, but too much of it may introduce unwanted complexity."

    "body": "Especially in languages that are supposed to be very performant, many developers tend to feel the need to write performant code. Code gets written in a specific way \"because it's faster\", usually coming with a number of problems:\r\n\r\n* Readability is sacrificed to the performance god and clean code principles are willfully or ignorantly violated. (reference to #59 )\r\n* It is not proven by a profiler that the code, written that way, is actually more performant. Instead, it is \"known\" from war stories and lore from the past that this is The Way Things Have to be Done :tm: (Reference to #31 )\r\n* It is not proven by a profiler that performance is actually _needed_ at that point in the code. \r\n* While focusing on the low-level optimizations one may oversee that the overarching algorithm is not as effective as it could be.\r\n* Optimizers are actually prevented from doing their work because the code does not demonstrate well-known patterns that are recognized by the optimizer.\r\n\r\nBottom line: \r\n\r\n1. Write clean and maintainable code first\r\n2. Check your algorithms for efficiency\r\n3. Use benchmarking and profiling to show that and where optimizations are needed\r\n3. Only as a last resort apply manual optimizations, guided and verified by the profiler\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Everyone started small. Even the tallest and strongest tree started as a seed and over time, thanks to a lot of sunlight, rainfall and good soil it became a deep-rooted, reliable and sturdy tree. And every year in the summertime it offers shade and fruits to anyone who appreciates it.\r\nVery much the same also applies to us, people who are involved in project work, where we try to give our best effort to make the project a success. \r\n\r\nWe work in projects as a subject matter expert, as an experienced project leader or as a newcomer that will need support from the team to grow to a new leader. Roles and tasks are assigned based on experiences we made in previous assignments. Experiences from former projects are our soil. We are able to grow on new and demanding tasks but will fail on overwhelming tasks. \r\nIf our responsibility lies within our comfort zone and is business as usual, we will not reach our limits. We need challenges such as finding new solutions and new approaches to grow. Just as a plant that needs more and more space to become bigger and greater we need space and the opportunity to make own decisions and take responsibility.\r\nWe need managers who see a potential for a project but also skills for staffing such a project with team members. Managers that are aware of the strength and weakness of each person and if there is a realistic feasibility that person can perform well and do a great job within the project.\r\n\r\nBesides the soil a plant needs right at the beginning also some kind of pillar. As long as the roots are not deeply anchored, and the stem is still fragile it is important that the plant is supported. It is exactly like that with us trying to grow in our projects. By having all these challenges and opportunities to grow, sometimes we will make a mistake. Sometimes we are not fulfilling expectation of our stakeholders, maybe our estimation or planning was wrong due to wrong assumptions, we took wrong decisions or communicated not well or the way we act was not as good as expected from our sponsor. These are the moments we need support and orientation when this situation takes us to our limits. We need someone taking care of us, helping, that we will not break in the storm but become stronger and to be prepared for the next time we face a similar situation.\r\n\r\nMost often we expect the project lead to support and stands up for us, but this is not always the case. This may be because of personal reasons or up to political topics like internal - external employee. From my perspective that doesn't matter if it is the PL or anyone else, as long as I know right from the beginning if I can count on this person or who is going to support me. This supporting person should be within the project stakeholders or at least within the area affected by my activities. It could be the PL, the sponsor, a team lead, someone from operation, business representatives and so on. Crucial is, that this person is aware of the project and what's going on, that I am linked and in close contact with the person, that I have an open and transparent communication to the person and that the person is a supporter of mine. For this reason, you should setup bilateral meetings or ask for feedback.\r\n\r\nEven if our terrain is nutritious and we have support, we still need water, heat and sunlight to grow. Only with this we can become what we shall or would like to be. Within our project that means that we have someone close to us who ensures that we deliver on time, within the expected quality and that we will not only choose the easy way but also try new solutions if time and place are right. We need someone who gives us the food required, meaning the tasks that match to us.\r\n\r\nAssuming that this is the easiest way and what we will find most often within projects. People are asking for help or review, pair programming e.g. peer groups outside project to share experience and ask for advice. As this is most often related to objective questions or tasks, my experience is that most often people are happy to be linked with others to improve their working results. Most often in self-organizing teams' team members switch tasks from one to each other to have best match of skills and performance for the respective task. Maybe you have also the possibility to be supported by a consulting coach or mentor.\r\n\r\nThe last aspect I would like to share may be the most critical one. But it is also part of the process of growing. All of you that have a garden with trees or roses will be aware of the fact that sometimes you have to cut down old boughs and branches to enable the plant to grow any further. Even if it seems as if the plant is destroyed and will never come to life again, latest at spring it will be back again, greater and brighter than ever before (if it was not cut too much but in an accurate way). Same is valid for us human beings. Sometimes we need someone telling us where we have bad behaviors, where we follow old patterns and where we should be open for new ones.\r\n\r\nWe may not be pleased to hear where we are not performing well but sometimes we have to decide if we are going to take feedback as an advice to follow or not. Any feedback should at least lead us to reflect ourselves, even if we decide that what we did was ok, and we will not change anything. Possible ways to grow are for example to ask for a 360-degree feedback from team members, peers and supervisor. Additionally, it is key always to reflect ourselves and the feedback we received. Therefore, it is important that we know our own strengths and weakness and find ways how to strengthen the strength and to overcome out weaknesses. An external personal mentor or coach can also be very helpful; also, soft skills training or professional literature can help to expand your personal horizon.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of my recommendation is to check staffing of the project team right at the beginning. Not only the availability of the resources but also if they fit for the project. Sometimes it seems to be a good idea to have a \"training on the job\" setup. In this case it is important to ensure that there is someone within the project taking over the trainer role and to consider this approach inside the project planning (time and budget) to give enough space to grow otherwise it will be frustrating for all involved persons. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of each and every one of us to take the opportunity to grow by looking for our personal gardener or a growth concept as well as being prepared to be the gardener for someone else to accompany in the growth process.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "After 1.5 years solely ‚ÄúZ√ºhlke project teamwork‚Äù a colleague transferred to a project team with people from several service providers. After a few days he complained the way of working and the approach in his new project was so completely different compared to what he was used to work with Z√ºhlke teams. He was afraid that this will not become a successful project following this approach.\r\n\r\nAnother colleague switched from several Z√ºhlke-led projects to another project in which he was the only Z√ºhlke employee. After one month where procedures within the project seemed to have changed arbitrarily on a daily basis and with inexistent internal communication, he was frustrated and wanted to leave the project.\r\n\r\nI joined and supported this project team during the transitional period for 2 months. After a few days only it became already clear to me that I would not be able to work efficiently in this project because leadership and communication were so different from how I would have set up and managed the project.\r\n\r\nThese are three real examples from my close environment and three times the question is: Is it bad just because it is different and how do I best deal with this ‚Äúdifferences\" without running away?\r\n \r\nTo use the words from Henry Ford I see three ways of how to act: ‚ÄúLove it, leave it, or change it‚Äù\r\n \r\nThe most gallant way to deal with the situation is to accept it. But not only accept but support the way of working, the maybe different mindset and change to own behavior in a way it will be aligned to the others. The benefit of this approach is that it will cause little friction within the project. But the most important point from my point of view is, that you are able to try different ways of working, new approaches and have the possibility to learn and increase your personal level of growth as you are on a new path you would maybe never chose by yourself and you have the possibility to gain further experiences. Key point from my point of view is, to remain true to yourself and to show your integrity always.\r\n \r\nIf the situation will change in a way you are no longer able to deal with it won‚Äôt help just to talk about it in a negative way. Then it is time for a change. Change starts with each one of us with small things. The way we share or ask for information, we talk to each other, we act within meetings and how we support team members or maintain our network. By enforcing change, you have the possibility to bring the project to the next level of maturity. But there is also a certain risk that you force a change that is not appropriate just because you are used to work in that way. And you have to keep in mind that most people are not enthusiastic about hearing that someone questioning their way of working and that they should change anything by themselves. Worst case they try to make your life worse than before, reduce your involvement and so on. Just be prepared what may happen. Therefore, I suggest handling people with care and take them into the flow of change by showing them what they can gain and why they will benefit from the change.\r\n \r\nYou may have tried to adapt to your teams‚Äô way of working but then you found out that this will not satisfy you. And you tried to change the way things are going, but instead of finding a solution that fits for all, you simply found rejection and resistance. At this point of time best alternative is to leave the court. Not as an escape but as a protection for yourself and the team if this situation is not acceptable and proposals are not welcome.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day you will have to be able to look at your mirror and decide for yourself whether you can take the decision or not. Was the action of the others fundamentally wrong or just different? Was I too comfortable to get involved in the new approach or did I try my best to be efficient in the project? Were my suggestions for change appropriate or did I offend my colleagues rather than motivate them? All these questions can help with the decision - love, change or leave - to be at peace with myself.\r\n"

    "body": "Setup a project in an efficient way is not an easy task. To share visions of the project or of the project lead, to ensure that all are aligned and have a common understanding of how the project will be managed. In the meantime, most of the project leads started to have kick off workshops, not only 1h but one day with teambuilding and vision sharpening, not only once but depending on the project duration in regular intervals. \r\n \r\nBut how does it look like at the end of the project? Is everyone aware of how long he is involved in the project? What are the tasks when the project is coming to an end? When will be the last working day? What will happen with the project deliveries after project closing? Who is going to ensure operations starting when and how?\r\n \r\nThis is what unfortunately I observe within the most project setups, also confirmed by my colleagues:\r\n \r\nSometimes Ops and Support were involved to late or not in an efficient way due to time constrains or other reasons. Therefore, they are not enabled to takeover tasks and responsibility.\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, transfer to operation is not proceeding because the project team is still receiving all new requests and tries to handle these. \r\n \r\nAnd as there might be a certain kind of uncertainty in terms of how things are going and how much longer we will be involved in the project, people are happy to be contacted and needed.\r\n\r\nThose situations lead to the fact, that knowledge transfer and handover does not take place, but resentment due to unclear responsibilities takes over.\r\n\r\nSometimes project lead simply says there is no more work and there is no information flow any longer. Project members feel dropped, not appreciated and some kind of frustration sinks in. \r\n \r\nBy the way, similar might happen when project members are assigned to a new project and expectations are not aligned between project members, former and new project leaders.\r\n \r\nAnd last but not least a completely different aspect: people are getting frustrated because of all the learnings they did within the project, realizing, that in the end the new project is making exactly the same failures right at the beginning.\r\n \r\nBased on these Insights I would like to give you 6 suggestions of what can be done to reduce or avoid previously mentioned situations.\r\n \r\n1. Involve Operations and support as soon as possible\r\nHere I do not mean just invite them to the team meeting, but also ask them what are their expectations to the project and what do they need to be able to take over responsibility at the end of the project. Ask them for Document review and involve them as tester. Create an informal documentation of all issues and decisions taken as further reference and handbook. \r\n \r\n2. Give the transition phase a name, define, plan and communicate this phase\r\nAs the development will be planned beforehand also transition needs to be planned in advance. Official communication that this phase will now start and what will be the achievements of this phase will help all involved people and give some kind of orientation.\r\n \r\n3. Redefine roles, responsibilities and meetings in the team and communicate the result\r\nWith the new phase and activities also responsibilities will change. Maybe a business analyst will no longer be responsible for requirements only but also for training and support of the support team or test manager will no longer be needed. Some tasks shall be done by operations now and no longer by the project team itself. Therefore, a new definition of roles and responsibilities in the team is crucial as well as communication of the new assignments. Team meetings or defect meetings maybe are no longer required. Therefore, meetings to discuss existing production issues, progress within trainings or performance and usage statistics are more relevant. From my perspective it is better to stop old meeting series and setup new meetings with new agenda and participants instead of reusing old ones to have an official shift.\r\n \r\n4. Looking for contact with the team member and their supervisor \r\nSometimes team member will be lured to directly change to another project. Sometimes this is not the case. Anyway, as project manager I recommend to discuss with the supervisor by when the team member is leaving the current project and to which share the person will work in the new project or can take over new tasks outside the current project. This agreement should be taken between supervisor, project lead(ers) and team member in order that all have the same view of the situation.\r\n \r\n5. No project without any learnings\r\nInvite right beforehand all team members to a lessons learned meeting. Ensure that the meeting will either be split in separate ones if there are too many people involved for a common retro or search for someone to support you doing the lessons learned workshop, maybe as a ‚Äúworld caf√©‚Äù. Good practice, from my experience, is to make the project stages visible by putting cards on the wall, for each month and each event during the project duration. I also saw such a review in way of a collage or story / poem. As a source of information, you can use the monthly status reports or your project diary. You will be amazed of what happened (and you already forgot about it) and what you and the team achieved. One important point for me is, that at the end of the meeting every one of the participants has the possibility to write the own lessons learned for themselves and take these notes with them into the next project. Maybe you can prepare some cards beforehand and hand them out as template that they can fill out. You can also ask your team members either for feedback to your job or if they want you to provide them feedback about themselves. To be prepared for these activities it is helpful to start writing a project diary and note some keywords each week what happened, what was good, what was bad, what are my learnings and also in your private project diary what happened to all team members so that you can see their development through the time being.\r\n\r\n 6. ‚ÄúGoodbye and thank you for the fish‚Äù\r\nMost often project leads forget to take some budget in account for celebration of the project success or have a small give away as ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to the project members. No matter if you have any budget or not, it would be a good habit to invite your team members in advance to a project closing meeting. Purpose of this meeting is to officially hand over all responsibilities to the operation team and relieve the project team. That is also a good possibility to reflect the past month and perform a project review. Summarize the findings from your lessons learned meeting and share the impressions of that. This is the moment to say thank you. Maybe by some personal words to each member, a card with some keywords what was special to the person during the project duration, photos, etc... There are many possibilities to show recognition without expensive gifts or events.\r\n \r\nAs a conclusion in my opinion a successful project closure must be prepared already at the beginning of the development phase. Documents should be updated with each sprint or iteration and each learning and insight should be documented in a way that this can be handed over to support and operation to enable them to solve issues by themselves. Also some kind of project diary for the whole project might help at the end of the project to remember what happened, what has been done to solve issues and if these measurements were successful. As the project has a planning phase at the beginning, so does it have a transition phase when it is coming to an end. Here I dare to make the statement that transparency gives security. Talk about what‚Äôs going on, what are the plans and involve all team members and stakeholders as you have (hopefully) done at the beginning of the project.\r\n"

    "body": "Everybody in the software industry will come to a point when one has to enter a new project. Then, we need to familiarise ourselves with a different project environment and depend on other team members. Our decisions have to be thought out carefully until we become familiar with the project. Clearly, it is desirable to keep the transition-time as short as possible. A way of achieving this is by taking notes in a structured way. When we join a new project, this enables us to become an efficient team member as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the past decades, more and more software projects have shifted to agile methodologies like Scrum. Because of that, the software industry requires employees to become more self-organised. Team members with this skill require less management and increase the project velocity on that way.\r\nIn this article, I show you how to organise your notes, handwritten and digital, so you can incorporate faster in new projects.\r\n\r\n# Ways to organise notes\r\nStoring notes electronically on your laptop is the standard way to go. There are many different alternatives like Microsoft OneNote, Evernote, or your project‚Äôs wiki. You should consider to note following information of the project. However, having a laptop on hand is not always an option. Sometimes you need to take handwritten notes. There are different solutions, like a tablet with a pen or a paper notebook. In my optinion, the best combination is between a tablet or paper notebook and a laptop.\r\n\r\nIn order to organise your notes, I recommend using the outlining method [Oxf17]. To me this has proven to be very effective to filter important information and concentrate on keywords. You can even further enhance this by summarising flows and using arrows to create connections. The usage of drawings and abbreviations can improve your note taking even more. While taking notes, however, you should not forget to keep eye contact with the speaker from time to time.\r\n\r\n# Take notes to get started\r\nTo get started in the project, you should identify individuals that can provide you access to the infrastructure, wiki, and task tracking board. For project related abbreviations, it might be a good idea to maintain a glossary. Once you get access to the project glossary, you can update your entries to it. By looking at the task tracking board or the wiki and by talking to stakeholders, you can gather valuable information about the Use Cases of the software your team works.\r\n\r\n# Take notes to advance\r\nOnce you got started in the project, you can gather further information so you stand out in the project very quickly.\r\n* Some tasks that you perform can occur more than once. If that is the case, your team might benefit from notes of the single steps. This also helps you to dive into the project faster and remove impediments in the project as an independent member.\r\n* Maintaining a stakeholder list and stakeholder matrix will help you to prioritise their demands. If you combine their intentions with the stakeholder matrix you will be able to steer the project better.\r\n![blo_grafik_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7230475/42926057-89f8c79c-8b30-11e8-9ee5-e63555526aa8.jpg)\r\n* It is crucial that you understand the vision of the project. The vision consists of a compelling destination, a strategic roadmap, and aligned partners [Hen11]. It helps you to identify the ideal end state of your project. The strategies of the project roadmap should be your base to make decisions that are aligned with the project‚Äôs vision.\r\n![blo_grafik_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7230475/42926066-909a20f0-8b30-11e8-8456-92d55d1a569d.jpg)\r\n* Considering the team‚Äôs experience is very important. They have a concept of how to steer the project and how to avoid mistakes that have been made before. However, you also should gather enough information to make your own informed decisions.\r\n* You should keep a record of your ideas, preferably in a Kanban board. To evaluate your ideas, you can calculate their return of investment and alignment with the project‚Äôs vision. To prioritise your ideas you should consider whether and how much you can leverage them for your project‚Äôs current situation. Also it is a good ideal to bring up your ideas in meetings or talk with your colleagues and challenge them together.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\nWhen you join a new project, you have to deal with various types of information related to this specific project. You have to be able to extract the important bits and pieces by interacting with the team. Then you have to take notes of this information and store it, either handwritten or on your laptop. By doing this in an organised way with structured notes, you can quickly get to a point where you thrive and increase your performance. In not time, you will be valued as a fully featured team member and you can participate on important decisions.\r\n![blo_grafik_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7230475/42926073-96282a44-8b30-11e8-9c11-d09e3086a40f.jpg)"

    "body": "A well-known scenario seen in almost any larger IT-department is the development of a whole set of similar but slightly different applications built on a shared technical basis.  During the lifecycle of these applications different teams get their hands on them: Initially during development and later on for maintenance.  To ensure this can be done efficiently a common pattern is to set up a \"framework project\" to provide a \"rock solid\" basis for upcoming application development. These kinds of project are not only expensive, but, unlike a real application, they provide no direct value for the company's business. Additionally, often times they fail to comply to the requirements of applications they are to support.\r\n\r\nIn our experience there is a better approach to this problem: Instead of creating a framework up front, we started by creating a first application. We then used this application to iteratively and incrementally create a set of building blocks serving as a basis for future application development. This helped to not only provide a common architecture across multiple applications but also in greatly reducing the ramp-up time for new projects from five months to five minutes!"

    "body": "The higher level / the broader / the bigger an automated test / check is, the more likely it can become flaky. In order to maintain a stable set of system tests, it is vital to deal with this potential flakyness. Here are some tips that can help:\r\n\r\n1) Choose a good test design. I.e. make sure you have all components of the test under control. Don't rely on other teams systems if possible. Mock them away so you have full control. Create System Tests instead of System Integration Tests.\r\n\r\n2) Make the test failure pattern visible:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3780183/29554529-cb66dc16-871f-11e7-93a3-eca1a116ccd3.png)\r\n\r\n3) Avoid broken window, insist on keeping the tests green. There's usually a root cause to every flaky test. Either it's the test itself that needs improvement or it's a bug in the software. And you don't want to miss a bug, right?\r\n\r\n@bruderol @tobiaszuercher @peitor @abeggchr Do you have more input for this one?"

Dont even think about it! And let's immediately refactor all our tests accordingly!)\r\n* \"do not write ANY source code comments! We write Clean Code instead - POINT\"\r\n* \"Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\" --> so dont ever create an instance of a class directly, always only depend on interfaces.\r\n* \"do not automate any e2e/UI tests - because the test pyramid says that we should just focus on the lower level of the pyramids and e2e/UI tests are slow and fragile anyway - so let's not loose time with such things and instead write only fine granular unit tests and those should only cover one class and always mock ALL the other collaborators - like I learned it in that cool blog I read about unit testing!\" (there are very good arguments for UI/E2E tests and many advantages over unit tests and the pyramid was probably not meant to say: WRITE NONE!)\r\n   \r\nAnd please do not get me wrong: I like Agile Manifesto, Git Flow Branching Model, Feature Branches, Martin Fowler in general and even his article about Page Object Pattern. As well I like Clean Code, SOLID Design Principles and TDD using Unit-Tests - those are all practices I appreciate a lot and that influenced my way of thinking and working - but still all of this things have a lot of danger inside, if just following them stupidly and in a very dogmatic way.\r\n\r\nThis could also make a good introduction, because that might be important to be aware of when reading any other advice in the articles of our book. And it is also a general good philosophy and spirit for project work. I think this spirit should be something that we take care of throughout the book, to well define in each article in what context something is meant and where also the limitations or disadvantages or even dangers or pitfalls of each approach/idea are.\r\n\r\nFollowing yammer thread and especially the comments by @damphyr inspired me, to write something about that: https://www.yammer.com/zuehlke.com/#/Threads/show?threadId=832088152\r\n--> \"Sterile, mechanic \"rules\" to be followed more or less religiously as if somehow you can substitute critical thinking and adaptive methods\"\r\n@damphyr Thanks! \r\n\r\nSo this should be a pleading for we have less to fight against such dogmas and all try to be open and think well about how to do something in a project instead of following blindly any rule set and causing troubles with this to the project or our colleagues."

    "body": "I believe many people are already codifying their server infrastructure as code via Chef, Ansible, etc, but setting up Developer VMs in an automated fashion is probably something only few people do.\r\n\r\nThere is 45 minutes conference talk I have to prepare some slides / examples for, and I believe that some of that material could be reused here.\r\n\r\nTo be discussed in this article:\r\n\r\n * why you want to do that, the problems you want to avoid and the benefits you gain\r\n * how to do that, conceptionally (sth like 5 golden rules for setting up developer vms)\r\n * maybe a mini example, or at least links to examples we have on our zuehlke github account\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. talk info below:\r\n\r\nTitle: Automatisierte Entwickler VMs -- \"works on my machine\" z√§hlt nicht mehr\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\n> Die Automatisierung von Server Systemen durch Configuration Management Werkzeuge wie Chef, Ansible, usw ist weit verbreitet. Gute Tipps zur automatisierten Erstellung von Entwickler VMs (= die Desktop Umgebung f√ºr die Entwickler mit IDE, Compiler, Build tools, usw) findet man jedoch eher selten. Dieser Vortrag versucht genau diese L√ºcke zu schlie√üen, und zeigt einen Ansatz um mit Vagrant und Chef Entwickler VMs zu erstellen: warum das √ºberhaupt n√∂tig ist, wie man Entwickler VMs aktuell h√§lt und dabei kontinuierlich (nat√ºrlich automatisiert) testet, und wie sie auf einfache Art und Weise verteilt werden k√∂nnen. Die genannten Beispiele sind Open Source und k√∂nnen direkt wiederverwendet werden.\r\n> \r\n> Der Vortrag enth√§lt mehrere Demo Anteile. Zielgruppe sind Entwickler, Architekten und alle die ein Interesse an konsistenten und reproduzierbaren Entwicklungsumgebungen haben. Die Code Beispiele sind in Vagrant / Chef DSL (Ruby), Grundkenntnisse in einer Programmiersprache s. \r\n```"
