# Machines - Code - People: 50 things Zühlke engineers are passionate about 

## Vision

We create a **collection of articles** containing advices we'd like to share with our collegues at Zühlke and with the world of Engineering in general (e.g. potential new colleagues and customers).

We write for all engineers at Zühlke and outside of Zühlke - from professional engineers to distinguished consultants - and from future engineers to alumnis.

Through our articles, the Zühlke culture manifests itself: they contain practicaly proven concepts, best practices, cultural philosophies and great ideas, they are technically interesting, they motivate you to reflect about the work and they encourage you to share your knowlege and experiences.

## How to contribute
