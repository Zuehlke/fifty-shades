Christian is a software architect and has been working at Zühlke since 2007. In his project work, his passion goes into continuously improving quality, providing a rock-solid architecture, writing the right tests and setting up reliable build pipelines.
He never ceases to be amazed by what people can achieve together when they collaborate and work to each other's strengths.

Peter hates bad products. So, he joined scrum.org and Zühlke, where he works with people, teams and organisations to try to improve the software engineering profession.
The drive for improvement (and the smell of coffee) gets him out of bed in the morning.
Peter is on a journey to make everyone happy. If he isn't riding a mountain bike or playing the trumpet, you might find him at a local user group, hanging out with other nerds!
