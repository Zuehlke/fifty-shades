## What are Core Principles of the Digitalization?

There is no doubt that we all are in the middle of a digital transformation. For most companies it is clear that they are somehow affected by digitalization. However it is less clear to them HOW they are affected and WHAT they should do to get prepared for the challenges of the future.

It all began with the launch of the Internet and then seemed to slow down after the Dot-Net-Bubble. But in 2007 it really started off with the launch of the iPhone and it became obvious that computer power had reached pocket size and that “the availability of information at your fingertips” was the new state of the art. 

But what exactly has changed? And are there common patterns of Digitalization in all the different industries and business areas? What should a company do to remain competitive in the new digital age? 

It is important to understand the core principles of digitalization to align the actual business with the future: 

### 1. Global availability and tradability of digital services and products

We notice many small changes in our daily life but easily overlook the dramatic changes as a whole: Telephone booths have vanished in a few years, CD-shops have disappeared from the streets, kiosks transform from paper magazine sellers to digital accessoires shops. cinemas are fighting for survival as customers can stream the formats without latency and enjoy the films wherever they are and whenever they want. Advertisements appear more and more often between our online news but disappear in newspapers (which themselves have a tendency to disappear). Augmented reality warns us of traffic jams, right when they happen and interactive street maps with GPS positioning have replaced the paper street maps. When you try to imagine what kind of products you do not need anymore because you have it now on your mobile, you might have difficulties to write down the first 20 things but then you will hardly be able to stop writing. 

Even more important is that these digital products are globally tradable and almost immediately available.  You just download a book when you first hear about it and seconds after that you can read it. A train ticket from Zurich to Stuttgart can be bought in Switzerland or in Germany and you will probably do so wherever it is faster, cheaper, easier or more convenient. 

Todays customers on service homepages don’t complain very often but they are susceptible to a good and friendly service. They want to get an immediate but personal service and publicly rate the service provider and the user experience on the internet. When a family member got a wrong medical treatment and had problems to get hold of the doctor, I made the treatment public and suddenly it was astonishing to us, how easy we could find a mutual beneficiary solution with the hospital under the condition that the rating would disappear as soon as corrective measures were taken by the hospital. 
Multi language trading platforms link sellers and buyers and much of the traffic on those platforms consists of electronic online transactions. And if a service is down, customers might change to a different platform within seconds and without hesitation – maybe to never come back again. 
We realize that in our digital world we can lose our clients before we have even met them for the first time. _Never ever have processes been more critically important than today in order to satisfy the clients and customers!_

### 2. Vertical and horizontal integration among Customers, Partners and Suppliers

Clients, suppliers and partners are often in the same commercial network to profit from “just in time” advantages. There are new ecosystems and platforms evolving that offer advantages in logistics (like crossdocking synergies, delivery services, billing and dunning services right up to factoring services to the participants). The automation helps to serve millions of global customers digitally, easily, friendly and personal.
Sometimes it just makes sense for the customer to get everything out of one hand and you often do not need resellers for digitalized goods anymore. Global sellers like Amazon or Apple have learnt to address end-users effectively. Some companies realize only to late that they are about to fall out of the process or get into a new dependency because their customer relations are not aligned with the digitalization needs. _Only companies that are focused on the needs and values in the view of the customer will make the change and are prepared to stay independent and to play it strong._

### 3. The value of a constant data stream for digital services

The data streams that result from customer interaction, transactions and inquiries but also from registered customer habits have become a major source of income and research alike. Not only is Google for example able to design customer profiles but also can they constantly improve their search algorhythms. This allows to constantly improve over the competitors (that still try to level up with Google search). The advertising market depends on this kind of information in order to even better personalize and address the customer. Companies with good access to the customers like Facebook, Google and Amazon can innovate new intelligent products based on this data. And last but not least the service of products can improve if valuable data is available. _This data stream is an extremely valuable asset and companies cannot allow not to use it._

There are products like harvest machines for farmers, where people would assume that these heavy machines will always remain purely physical. But the data stream of those physical products can lead to new kinds of after sale services. 

John Deere has videos that illustrate the digitalization and new ease for the farmers in connection with IOT concepts. This data might additionally be used for predictive maintenance or might be enhanced with IOT concepts and could enable a whole new type of return for the value chain. _The data stream is a competitive advantage that helps to design new digital services, especially in evolving domains._

### 4. The value of data streams for the physical world

However digital information might not only be used for digital extension of the service range: While I was writing this article, Amazon announced that they would use their digital information about the physical products also in order to optimize physical book stores. At Amazon’s six physical stores, books are arranged on shelves face out, even though this takes more space. They are not trying to cram the entire inventory into these stores; Amazon figures you can just order everything else from your phone. They also devote a lot of space to their Kindle e-readers, streaming TV devices and other gadgets, so you can try them out before buying. 

## What is the takeaway for companies that are affected by digitalization?

First of all, digitalization favorizes platforms that link buyers and sellers in the same ecosystem. If done well, other companies might want to profit from your excellent relation with your customers. In the long run it might be more profitable to own and run such an ecosystem than having a traditional business.

It is of paramount importance that you put the customer in the center of all your thoughts. Try to surprise him and provide for good feedback facilities in order to constantly learn about the customers needs and concerns. In order to achieve this, processes are not sufficient anymore as they reach to short and most of the time end in front of the company. What you need today, are user experience mapping tools to assess how the customer feels about the product and the service he gets.

Design the customer interactions from the outside to the inside: Increase the understanding how the (real) customer interacts with the provider, then design and speed up the interactions from and end2end perspective by eliminating media gaps and by increasing data quality.

Embrace technical advances for the customers advantage. New technologies often bring chances to improve the products or the service. The 5th generation mobile services have started in 2018 with the first calls and will be broadly introduced in 2020. They will eliminate the latency from connections so that driving cars in the traffic could interact in real time and optimize security on the streets. Have you already evaluated how this could also change the just in time concepts of your production?

And last but not least challenge your business models. Even though your business model has worked so far, it might be possible to add additional value streams with additional business models or with combined models. A good starting point for this might be Oliver Grassmann’s book “The Business Model Navigator: 55 Models That Will Revolutionise Your Business”.
