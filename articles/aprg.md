Architectural Programming (APRG) is a programming discipline for architectural elements and structures like servers, databases, load balancers or network components. The approach requires APIs for architectural elements and infrastructure to create and evolve an architecture model using code. For instance Azure, Google or AWS all provide such APIs with services ranging from IaaS, CaaS to PaaS.

With the first implementation of the APRG approach we extended Structurizr [TODO link to simon repo], an executable Architectural Description Language (ADL), with an explicit and coded relation to the cloud infrastructure that is actually needed to implement and execute the system [TODO l√∂ink to ched repo]. This bridges a gap that nowadays still exist in most software development projects, a gap between models and code.

The coded model is the very basis for an envisioned overall development workflow that allows for validating architectural decisions by executable quality attribute scenarios similar to validating acceptance criteria by automated functional tests. 

## Architecture Models in the Product Lifecycle
Architecture modelling takes user and business requirements into account to provide guiding structure and decisions for implementation and operation of a system ultimately delivered as a product to the customer.

Such a model comprises at least

- System Architecture for tiers, infrastructure and connectors between tiers
- Application Architecture(s) as a grey-box view of the different parts of the system architecture. This view details components and connectors between components 
- Quality Attribute Requirements specifying the qualities required from the resulting system
- Architectural Decisions as a record of options and explicit decisions to fulfil the given requirements

In the following we consider mainly the system and application architectures. An extension of the approach to requirements and decisions requires further research beyond what we have implemented so far.

## Architectural Erosion and the Model-Code Gap
Architectural erosion is the divergence of the architecture model from the source code and infrastructure that actually implements the model. It results in a model-code gap and usually happens stepwise during iterative and incremental development and maintenance of a system. The code and infrastructure evolves, but the architecture model is not kept in sync. After some time we end up with a model that describes the system as it was meant in the beginning but not as it is actually implemented and delivered. 

Such a system is often called "historically grown". It is difficult to maintain and to evolve since decisions are often implicit, based on local knowledge and are not comprehendable after some time any more. Fulfilment of quality attribute requirements is getting harder and harder to achieve.

## Towards Architecture as Code 
Our approach combines Architecture as Code with APIs for Infrastructure within the same code base. As an example consider the following simplified architecture of an eShop:

(TBD add the sys and app architecture sketch from the APRG meetup here, maybe redesigned with gliffy or the like)
	
The frontend tier initially integrates directly with the database. After some development iterations it is decided to separate the persistence logic into a repository component acting as a facade to the database. An update of the diagram according to this new component is necessary and if not done leads to architectural erosion. 

Instead of modelling the architecture in a diagram we may use code like the following:

(TBD add the example code here, should be in Chritsian's repository of the stucturizr extension)
	
Now, when this gets executed the corresponding Azure infrastructure and components are created and the system is ready to be used according to its description in the code.

Note that the implementation is based on Structurizr [TODO link], an executable ADL which also allows to generate architectural diagrams. Therefore we may additionally generate up-to-date views of our current models as needed in the system's Architecture Guidebook, for instance.

In case we need to evolve or refactor the architecture we work directly with the code. Only by this means we are able to modify the actual system and hence the model is always in sync with code and infrastructure. Of course we could also change the system directly, but this is similar to changing code in a running system without updating the underlying source code in the repository, an anti-pattern which is hopefully nowadays nowhere practiced anymore. 

## Envisioned Development Workflow

How does the APRG approach integrate in the development workflow of a software product? We think the first important step is to have the model managed in the same repositories like the source code that implements the functionality of the system. This makes it easier to evolve the actual architecture model, since it is maintained in the same technical domain as the components within the architecture.

Using additionaly Architecture as Code instead of diagrams has several advantages. For instance, merging the code is much more intuitive, as the language can be the same as the source code itself and changes in the model are type safe (depending on the language you use), so all views will be taken into account whenever the model is modified. 

Finally, code can be executed and tested. If architectural requirements are implemented as tests, the architecture might be deployed to a dedicated environment and then the tests executed similar to functional acceptance testing. If we change the architecture in the next iteration the tests may fail, indicating the incompatibility of the architectural change with the existing quality attribute requirements.
