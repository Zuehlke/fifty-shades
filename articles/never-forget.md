We code software. Every day, every hour; an endless stream of code gets written and merged into the products. The human's codebase is _massive_. Space Shuttle is working with 400K lines of codes. Large Hadron Collider takes 50 million lines. And all Google services combined work on 2 billion code lines.

The software runs technology. Tech becomes omnipresent in our lives; from pocket devices to augmented reality and the intelligence. The impact that technology is making on human lives is undeniable and inevitable. This fact has its burden: is the technology growing in the right direction?

The answer to that question echoes from the past: it can be found in the thoughts of the first computer engineers and among the ides of the first technology visionaries. They all state the very same message: the purpose of technology is not about having everyone interacting online all the time; tech is not a ubiquitous substitution-pill (hard) to swallow.

Technology is the _challenge_ for humankind to evolve. It's an opportunity to dramatically increase the collective knowledge to address the most challenging problems. It is a call to action for public and private sectors to recognize the exponential growth of humankind's challenges, and to provide the vigorous, proactive, strategic pursuit of meaningful evolution.

We, the developers, are makers, creators. We are given the tools and the power of producing the code that will shape the future. We must come with disruptive ideas that will lead to organizational and societal transformations. Such attitude should be part of the DNA of any software company; that shapes the products, services and the work. We are here not to code, but to answer the challenges.

Hello world, never forget to keep evolving.
