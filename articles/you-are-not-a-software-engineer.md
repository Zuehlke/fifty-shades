title: "You are not a Software Engineer" - What am I then?

# {{page.title}}

The job of Software Engineer, or any technical role for that matter, is vast. You might spend more time than you would like on meetings, you might spend your afternoon sending emails to your stakeholders, you actually might only get to write code for a couple of hours a day. Depending on your personality type, this can make you thrilled or make you unhappy. I am writing this for the latter.

This article is not about roles. Nor about daily duties. In this article, I offer a different view, in which our job is solving problems of business and making our customers happy, while coding is only a marginal tool in doing so. I maybe hit a nerve on this one, but it is even more important when working as a service provider. So hear me up.

## "But I am a coder, I don't want to deal with any of this."

Yes, I understand and I am too. Coding is fun, coding can be challenging, coding is the reason most of embarked on this journey. But if you think about it, code is made for the human consumption first. Yes, machines need to understand it as well, but if it wasn't for the people, we would still write in assembly, or binaries even. When you throw in daily collaboration with your team, managers, and clients, your job is really about dealing with people, not computers.

Let me put it this way. You may put in the work and produce 10.000 lines of cleanest, most optimized code there possibly is. If it doesn't bring value to the business, you can go ahead and throw it away. You can create a fresh, shiny feature, which works as a charm. The downside is, it takes 20 iterations, because of no deep understanding of what the customer really needs. And maybe after the second iteration, you could tell that customer need would be fulfilled with an entirely different feature.

## What is your drive?

You don't want to just play around and not produce anything of worth to someone, I hope.

According to recent models of motivation ("Drive" by Daniel Pink), our actions are fueled from autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

In healthy working environments, autonomy is easy. You have the power to decide how will you implement the solution, to choose working mode which enables you to do so, and influence decisions, within your ability.

Mastery is the urge to improve your skill set and be proud after all the work you have done. This moves us. To change projects, gather new experiences and work with new technologies. Since IT field is a fast-moving freight train, I assume you are already doing this.

Purpose can be tricky, though. The desire to do something that is of meaning and importance, greater than ourselves. Maybe helping already successful enterprise earn 5% net profit greater than previous year is not your thing. Maybe you want to help humanity find the cure for cancer. Boarding on some ideas is easy, while others not. I will not provide an answer to this. It is entirely up to you. I will give you a hint though. It is everywhere. It involves feelings.

## "I am in the business of creating value."

Remember the cost of fixing a bug, depending on the stage of software development lifecycle. An hour spent in requirements engineering will save you many more down the road. You might use a framework designed to prevent this from happening, prescribing you the points in time when you should do requirements engineering. But, all the magical frameworks in the world will not help you, if you don't understand what you are building.

## "I am in the business of satisfying customer."

If you consider yourself as a one-man business, your customer is every person you interact with. Your customers are your team members, management, stakeholders, users. Keeping them happy is of importance for your business, even if you need to make a couple of trade-offs. Sometimes, you might feel disconnected from the customer. Either he is really busy and doesn't come by, or you see him perhaps once on a release review. Establishing that link creates a fertile ground for collaboration. Having it is your right, and responsibility.

## Anybody can code

After all, we live in a world where anybody can code.

> "Have you heard? The other supplier was X times cheaper".

All over the world, you can find coders capable of writing code. And doing it cheap!

Why would the customer choose you, over any other provider?

> "We use sound design principles, and our architecture is flawless!"

Yes, kudos to that, you should really keep it. Selling your work like that totaly make sense - if all your customes are engineers. To others, that doesn't mean much. When the end result is the same - working software, being proud of ourselves, thinking that we can do it better than others, is not a good selling point.

## Own the market

While competing on price is not an option, we might just have a few other tricks in our sleeve. If the customer enjoys working with you, because you can communicate more clearly, you understand his business and you are actively helping him in making better decisions for his business, those are the skills that make the difference.
