title: Do something about that slow SQL query

# {{page.title}}

No, you probably won't need more memory, faster disks or CPUs. To start solving database performance problems, first of all, you need understanding. So, let's start removing veil of mystery from SQL performance topic. Let's understand what can we do to make our database run faster.

Typical performance problem would be one large query executing for a long time, or enormous amount of micro queries bringing the database server to his knees.

First of all, you need to understand the cause of the problem. Do not optimize blindly. Find a way to monitor all processes on a troublesome server. Be sure that there is no other process that suffocates the server, i.e. that the slowness of the database is not caused by some external factor.

If the database is the one that exhausts most server resources, you need to find out why that happens. Database essentially responds to a set of queries sent by clients, using the data that are stored in the tables. You need to have an insight into these queries to know which one of them exactly is problematic. The database, or the ORM framework, usually has the ability to record all the queries in the log file, as well as to measure theirperformance. It is vital that you are able to search the log files, find the number of queries at a certain time interval, find the slowest queries and frequently repeated queries. Sometimes for these things there is sufficient to manualy review a log files, and sometimes you will use tools (like pgBadger for the PostgreSQL database) that will dig and visualize this information.

If database is slow because of an unexpectedly large number of small but quick queries, then it is usually necessary to: 
1. Change the client so as not to send an unreasonably large number of queries, but to join more queries into one. A typical problem with ORM framework is unnecessary lazy loading. Carefully selected eager loading (either as part of query using "fetch join" construct, or declerative) can significantly reduced the number of queries and improve performance.
1. If a smaller queries are really necessary, then analyze the queries. It may happen that a lot of queries like ID/username lookup is being repeated over and over again. If that is the case, consider caching the results of often executed queries (either by using the ORM cache, or rolling your own). It may speed up total query execution time dramatically.

If the database has one very slow query, or several of them, then they need to be analyzed individually and possibly accelerated by those means:
1. Create indexes over appropriate columns (primary keys, foreign keys, columns in JOINs, columns for search / selection)
1. Create partial indexes (e.g. over active records, or over records of a particular type)
1. Avoid selecting unnecessarily large amounts of data (e.g. selecting all rows from big table when user might view only first couple of pages, or selecting all columns when only some of them are presented to the user)
1. Optimize correlated subqueries
1. Check the plan for query execution and database statistics, and update statistics if necessary

Finally, if the number of queries is within the expections, and the execution of each query is slower than expected, there may be a systemic problem and the solution is in checking the the configuration. E.g:
1. Not using the connection pool can slow down any query, because establishing a TCP connection takes time
1. Incorrectly configured memory allocations can contribute to unwanted swapping of virtual memory between RAM and disk, which is disastrous for performance
1. Wrong file system and RAID configuration (e.g. for PostgreSQL ZFS seems to be usual winner, and RAID 10 or several RAID 1 groups perform the best. Avoid jornaling on log partition file system, and avoid RAID 5 as it does not perform so well).
1. Wrongly selected storage. For example: NAS and SAN, despite similar acronyms, are very different storage solutions with completely different performance.
1. Not enough RAM. If the entire database (together with indexes) exceeds the available memory, performance may be poor. In the case of large databases that can not be completely stored in memory, it must be unavoidable, but in the case of smaller databases, the biggest performance jump is obtained if the whole database is in the memory.
1. Bad hardware. Sometimes you just need to get a better one.

Here we introduced some practical solutions how to tackle database performance issues, and this can be used as a starting point for you personal optimization conquest.
