# {{page.title}}

Imagine this quite common situation: Somebody, let's call her Andrea, has her preferred tools. But now, she is forced to use other tools at work. Now, Andrea has a choice: She can either react according to her (probably unconscious) preference, or she can choose her reaction based on what she wants to achieve. Here is one way of looking at her possibilities:

# Possibility 1: The Whiner

You can't imagine how much and for how long Andrea can complain about a tool. It is slow and this specific bug leads at least daily to undesired behaviour. And anyway, this tool is simply not as good as her favourite tool.

The core of the whiner: Even after years, Andrea complains about the same problems. During this time, she has neither learnt how the tool works nor found any of the workarounds her teammates use nor taken any steps to replace the tool.

In short, the whiner tries to convince others that her preferences are the best, but she doesn't take any steps to actually switch to her preferred tool.

# Possibility 2: The Evangelist

Whoever wants to list (and everyone else, too) will hear continuously from Andrea about all the advantages of her favourite tool. She does everything she can to have as many people as possible switch to her favourite tool, even if there are good reasons why up to now, something else was in use.

The big challenge of evangelists is that if they don't know the alternatives, they sound more like "I don't want to learn about this alternative" than like "I know something better". In the worst case, the functionality they point out as the biggest advantage has been implemented in an improved way in the very alternative they are trying to replace.

In short, the evangelist attempts to convince everybody that her preferences are the best and takes steps to have the whole team switch to her preferred tool.

# Possibility 3: The Tightrope Walker

Andrea decides consciously where she adapts and where she ignores team conventions and uses her preferred tools. This is a balancing act:

 * If your environment differs too much from everybody else's, pair programming will become more difficult.
 * Most companies have rules about what can be installed/used. Because Andrea most likely doesn't know the reasoning for each of these rules, she has to consider carefully which rules she breaks.
 * A tool you know well and that is configured to fit your preferences can increase your productivity and reduce your frustration.

The big difference between a tightrope walker and an evangelist is that the tightrope walker focuses on her own productivity and comfort. She doesn't attempt to convince anybody.

In short, the tightrope walker doesn't try to convince anybody, but simply uses whatever she prefers (as long as she believes that it is ok within the context).

# Possibility 4: The Chameleon

Even though Andrea has her preferred tools, she can work with many other tools. She adapts her way of working to fit the tool in use and continues to learn about each tool she uses. Given her experience with various tools, she can choose the tool that fits best to the problem at hand, even if the chosen tool isn't her favourite.

Like the whiner, the chameleon does not attempt to change anything. But the motivation is completely different: For the chameleon, the choice of the tool far less important than many other things.

In short, the chameleon neither attempts to convince anybody nor takes any action to change the situation. This is not due to resignation, but because the chameleon adapts and is happy with many tools.

# Conclusion

Each of these possibilities is useful in the right situation:

 * A bit of whining is a simple way to find out whether you're the only one who dislikes a specific tool. But remember to switch to some other possibility when that question has been answered!
 * Without evangelists, we would still use the tools from the last century. But please listen to the people in your context, there might be more pressing issues than the migration of some supporting tool!
 * Both the tightrope walker and the chameleon have a good chance to be able to focus on the big issues in many environments. But don't forget that sometimes, a migration is long overdue and needs your active support and participation.

No matter whether you work as a team member, as a consultant or in a management position: Your actions have an impact. Don't let your unconscious preferences rule your actions. Instead, adapt your behaviour to the requirements of the situation.
