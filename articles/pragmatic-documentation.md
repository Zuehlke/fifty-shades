# {{page.title}}

Writing documentation is a task that most developers and engineers just don't
like. The reasons for this are different, but the pattern I see is that they
are asked to write documentation without understanding:
* for whom the documentation is written,
* why
* how and
* where?

## For whom?
  
The first question - _Whom do I write for this documentation?_ - you should
have a clear answer before you even start writing. Sometimes these are exactly
certain people you know, sometimes they are existing users that you don't 
know, and sometimes it is not yet known who the readers will be.

If you are able to reach at least a certain portion of people who will read
your documentation, do it and talk to them about the documentation you are
writing. Explain to them that you are doing something they should use and that
you want to do it in the best possible way. It will surely help you, because
it is in their interest. After all, they are the ones who will eventually read
the documentation.

If your users are not yet known, it's best to try to imagine a future reader
and try to put yourself in his/her shoes. It's not always easy, but thinking
from the perspective of other readers -- albeit fictitious -- will help you
decide what to write.

## Why?

To the second question - _Why?_ - The answer is as follows: to explain to the
reader what he dosn't know. Remember this. If you explain to the reader what
he already knows, your documentation will be boring and will not be read. It
is therefore important that you understand what the reader does not know
before starting to write the documentation. If your documentation is read by
more than one person, the task is even more difficult. You need to know which
things most of your readers do not know, and which only individuals don't,
and accordingly organize the documentation.

## How?

When you have answers to the questions for who and why you are writing
documents, the third and the most difficult question - _How to write it?_ -
can be a little easier to answer. You must, the best you can, put yourself in
the role of a person in need of help. (Because no one reads the documentation
until he needs help.) So, put yourself in the role of reader and try to
imagine a very concrete thing that the reader fails to do or fails to
understand by himself. If you already have existing users, you can create
a list of questions that they would like to have an answer. It is not good
if the questions are general ("How is this software used?", "What is the
advantage of using the software?"), but on the contrary, it is better if the
questions are very specific ("How do I add a new user who is simultaneously in
Role A and Role B? "," Does the magnifying glass mean a search of data or a
detailed overview?"," How do I recover the object that I just deleted?",
Etc.). If the short answers to the collected questions are sufficient for your
users, then write them down, and call the documents FAQ or Q & A or something
like that.

Often, through the questions of future readers, you will understand that the
problem is that the reader lacks some knowledge in order to understand your
answer, in which case it will sometimes be necessary to help him acquire that
knowledge. One way is to add introductory chapters in which you will explain
the necessary concepts. Other way, if someone else has done it appropriately,
is to provide links in your documentation where the reader can supplement his
knowledge.

When you have a text in which you explain the concepts, links to external
materials, and the answers to questions that are troubling your users, you
will use this material to group and organize documentation so that it has a
logical and easily understandable structure. As with programming, try to
adhere to the principles of least surprise, that is, to put each chapter in
the place where most of the users first search it.

## Where?

Final question: _where to publish the documentation?_ Answer: Where most users
will first look. Help to log on to the system should be located as a link on
the Login page. Help for compiling and running an application can be a file
(for example, RUNNING.md) in the root of your project. Help for certain
functionality in your software is best if it can be available to the user
interaface where this functionality is, and HowTo article for DevOps - on the
corporate wiki / knowledge base.

So, the methodology is always the same -- putting yourself in someone else's
shoes. It is a powerful technique that can be used in various business and
private situations, but one of the best uses, in my opinion, is exatcly --
writing documentation.
