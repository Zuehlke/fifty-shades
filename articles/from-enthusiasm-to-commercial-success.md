Through history, the goal of every human has changed. At the beginning, the sole goal was to survive. With evolution of mankind, big percent of people could work regularly without worrying about survival. Today, our work is not only the source of our income. We want to feel that we are contributing and that we matter. We want our ideas developed. To achieve this, there are different important things to understand. 

Through this article, I will give some hints taken from my personal experience and experience of my coworkers. These hints could be summarized into following:
* Know your limits
* Do it now
* Know you priorities
* Know your audience
* Be ready for failure

Literally everything is achievable. But, there is also a price you need to pay to succeed in achieving it. Behind this slogan, there is more than just a motivational message. It also means that it is not only about the effort you put in, but also about how much time and resources you spend on it. And, you should not spend 100% of your day working, because private life is important for your happiness and can significantly improve quality of your work.

You should not postpone the start of your journey until "the time is right". The time will never be right. As a matter of fact, it will never be "more right" than now. So, if you want to make something big, the sooner you start, the better.

What you should also have in mind is that it is not only about putting enough effort. You need to thoroughly divide and plan your work by knowing your priorities. You can base your decisions on something like 80/20 rule. If you plan and prioritize your work properly, 20 percent of your work will give you 80 percent of the value. Of course, these numbers are not exact, but can show that majority of the value is delivered by first minority of effort you put into something.

No matter in which area you are working, you should know who your main target group is. Imagine you created a teleportation machine. If your product can only transport individual particles of dust, no one is going to be interested in that. Additionally, the outcome of your work must be beneficial for majority of your target audience. So, if your teleportation machine could transport humans, but only from your living room to your kitchen, you would impress many people, but nobody would use your masterpiece.

One of the things that is hardest for accepting is the fact that you should be prepared for failure. All the points mentioned before will help you. But, whatever you do, there is no silver bullet for succeeding in it. You will just have to repeat a try-fail sequence until you finally succeed. 

All these points are applicable when you are creating a product. But, would they be applicable when you are exploring a new area, let's say, a new technology? The answer is simple. If you cannot show the result of your work, you will not convince anyone that you are fluent in the area you explored. To do that, you need to create something that gets people's attention and that shows benefits of your work.

I would like to make an example by sharing my personal success story. In Zuhlke, we have focus groups. These are groups of people that are interested in some area and are putting an effort into exploring it. Some time ago, we started a focus group which explores augmented and virtual reality. We did some investigation and got the needed knowledge, but we realized that this is not enough. To show other people that we can do it, we decided to create an app that would launch us into sight. We analysed the market and noticed there are many different shared whiteboard applications, each of them lacking tactile feeling. So, that was our goal. While working on this app, we felt that we are contributing to the world and really cared about this product. The first version we implemented was not even close to final. But it was enough to show that it can be done and that we know how to do it. Eventually, we were heard, and, after some time, we got the commercial project.

There are many other examples inside our company such as this one. What is common for most of them is that they came out as a result of different focus groups. Thanks to these groups, our engineers gained expertise in many different areas. This was helpful for both the company and the engineers themselves. That is why companies should be willing to give some space to theirs engineers to develop their own ideas.

A journey to success is not a straight line. There is almost no chance that you will get onto something, make some effort and succeed. However, you can make it easier if you invest your time not only into implementation work, but also into the aspects mentioned above. They might seem less important, but can significantly reduce your effort and increase chances for your success.
