title: Some inconvenient truths about the digitalization of your business 
---
# {{page.title}}

Many companies today want to use digitalization to develop completely new – ideally disruptive - business models. In most cases, they intend to complement their product-related core business with "digital value-added services". In this article I summarize some inconvenient truths that I came across time and again. Let yourself be de-msytified, so that you can start the adventure of digitalization with realistic expectations.
Let's start with a basic realization – the first of eight uncomfortable truths: 

## 1. You are not disruptive with your digitalization strategy, but only part of a herd.

I know it sounds tough, but it's true: All managing directors today want Internet of Things and Data Analytics. Everyone wants a platform and talks about Minimum Viable Products. All of them demand "fail fast!" from their teams and have conducted design-thinking training courses. Smaller companies create "Digital Business Innovation" jobs, while larger ones build up entire incubators and make the obligatory detour to Silicon Valley.
That's fine. But unlike a few years ago such measures are already mainstream today. It is right and important to deal intensively with these topics. At first, however, they have not achieved more than the competition. But if you face the uncomfortable truth, chances are good that you are more successful than the herd. 

When it comes to digitalization, I also perceive an over enthusiasm to adapt new methods. But be aware:

## 2. There is no such thing as a silver bullet to realize radically new ideas.

Unfortunately, one need is repeatedly expressed: "You told us about Design Thinking, Lean Startup and Scrum. We've heard all that before. Don't you have a new method we don't know yet?" Here I must shout "Stop!" loudly. It is not important to use a method that no one else has. A structured approach is important and sensible - but the team composition, top management support and a positive failure culture are much more critical to success.
Many managers long for new, life-saving methods because they feel the following uncomfortable truth: 

## 3. It is much more challenging to use agile and lean startup methods than it sounds. 

Agility and Lean Startup sounds like a casual and fun way to work. This gives the impression that anyone who is sufficiently motivated and trained in a hip method can work this way. Unfortunately, these methods are anything but easy to implement and firstly require a great deal of discipline on the part of all parties involved – thorough formulation and validation of hypotheses. Secondly, fundamentally different leadership styles and a corresponding culture are needed.

Let´s take the popular business model canvas as another example: It is both a curse and a blessing of the canvas principle, that every team can fill out a business model canvas in a 60-minute brainstorming session and go home with the good feeling of having done something cool. After all, you always have a result. I claim: 98% of business model canvas end here and are therefore no more than a nice finger exercise, because the laborious work is just beginning: Derive hypotheses, formulate tests, arrange appointments with users, validate hypotheses, iterate the canvas, etc. This takes a lot of time, ties up resources and is usually quickly lost in the urgent daily business of the team members.

A reason why the complex validation of the hypotheses is often skipped could be the following problem:

## 4. You know your customers much less than you think.

When a manufacturer wants to digitalize its business, it is almost always a question of developing digital value-added services around the product. If you want to offer your customers valuable (i.e. paid) services, you need to know the small and big problems your customers have every day in the context of using your product. However, this is a completely different knowledge than what you previously needed for the development and distribution of your products. There are many treacherous "unknown unknowns" here, i.e. you don't even know what you don't know about your customers. And you didn't even need to know, because things like multi-level sales or tendering standards around the "product view" were enough. Suddenly, however, the focus is on a service view, networking and new "customer touchpoints".

Suitable for this are methods of Design Thinking for idea generation and the User-Centered Design Process in the implementation. But what is much easier and what everyone should do: Just drive out for a day with the service technician. You learn more about your customers than in all trainings and studies together. Promised.

Understanding your customers' needs in the context of digitalization is a challenge for your entire organization: from development, product management and sales to service. But that is not all, because the following unfortunately is true:

## 5. Digitalization does not fit into your existing organization chart.

Digitalization projects always bring with them the great challenge of being inherently cross-cutting. This makes the execution of digitalization projects very demanding, tough and time-consuming. At the same time, the "immune system of the company" prevents true radical new ideas from emerging in the company - or they ensure that these ideas are increasingly watered down in the implementation process, so that in the end not much of real novelty or even radicality remains.

If you feel these tendencies in your company, then the next truth may even be a relief for you:

## 6. Disruptive business models of the caliber of Uber and Airbnb do not come from Europe.

Many industrial companies would like to have a big hit in their industry. No wonder, because in every management lecture the usual suspects from the consumer world are cited as models of disruption. But it is no coincidence that the biggest ideas come from Silicon Valley, because nowhere else in the world so many innovation drivers are concentrated: the deeply rooted and serious claim to improve the world (for example, Google only tackles problems that affect at least one billion people); the availability of venture capital and the willingness to invest enormous sums; the quest for "moon-shot projects" (Elon Musk: "I want to die on Mars."); the openness to exchange ideas and accept failures; the density of top research institutions; the tolerant lifestyle in the most beautiful surroundings and much more.

Only rarely does a disruption worthy of the name come from another continent. Can you think of an example? The strengths in Germany and Switzerland for example lie elsewhere: in quality, thoroughness, safety and longevity – to name but a few.

The following truth may explain why the United States with its pioneering and discovering tradition is more successful than anyone else:

## 7. New business models are not designed, they are discovered.

Most companies expect a clearly defined path to success in the digitalization process. But there is no such thing. Look at how your company has come to the business models of today. You'll find in more than Two-thirds of the cases, the founders had once started with something completely different and only gradually discovered and satisfied the needs of their customers, which today make up their core business.

Typically, this observation also applies to digitalization projects: You start at one point with a (supposedly) good idea and then go out to the customer – to learn what he or she really needs. The goal must therefore be from the outset to discover reliable problems with the customer, for the solution of which your company can make a significant contribution. This is the core of the "Lean Startup" approach.

The question arises as to how digitalization projects can nevertheless become a business case. It is often the case with monetization, because: 

## 8. They cannot grasp the business models of digitalization in their existing business logic.

Companies know that digitalization will fundamentally change their business. However, you still want to display the result in your conventional business logic. Crazy, isn't it? This is only possible with an incremental innovation in which there is experience from the past and assured expectations for the future. Then, for example, a ROI can be calculated quite reliably.

At the core of digitalization, however, are two completely different things: data and the customer interface. Both cannot easily be monetized via the industry's existing sales channels. The success factors are rather the development and use of multi-faceted markets, the realization of network effects as well as fast scaling and large reach. Digitalization creates the basis for new business models that are not yet foreseeable. The appetite comes while eating, so to speak, and the best ideas come from working together with third parties. 

## What do we do with these findings?

First: Don’t digitalize your business. Instead build a new digital business. See the difference?

If you digitalize your business, you are a) cementing the status quo and b) most likely don´t make use of the full potential of digital. Digital allows you to totally rethink your business, the products and services you offer, the way you win, interact with and keep customers and who you do business with. Here are some hints on how to increase your chances of success:
* The deep-rooted conviction among top management that digitalization makes new paths possible and necessary – and the willingness to go down these paths with courage.
* Interdisciplinary teams that are free to break new ground with enough freedom and distance from day-to-day business and make mistakes in the process.
* Find customer problems before thinking in solutions. Usually there is no lack of ideas, but of well understood customer problems.
* The ability to learn openly and together with customers and partners what the individual path to digitalization looks like for their own added value.
* A positive error culture and agility to quickly and iteratively move from the initial solution idea to a viable business model - before the project runs out of money.
