                                <h1 id="successful-agile-system-development-with-continuous-system-integration">Successful agile system development with continuous system integration</h1>
<p>Continuous integration (CI) is a core practice of successful agile software development. A practice that makes agile systems development, e.g., development of a medical device, successful as well!</p>
<h2 id="continuous-integration-of-software">Continuous integration of software</h2>
<p>A CI infrastructure for software development (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Software CI&quot;) enables frequent integration of locally developed source code to the mainline of a software project, even several times a day. At the end of the build process, automated tests are run on different integration levels. Software CI helps in ensuring the consistency of the software and creating a potentially shippable software product on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The same advantages can be achieved by using embedded software as part of a system development project. Embedded software can be developed in an agile way almost without interfering with the development of the mechanical or electronic parts of a device.
The electronics of a device &#x2013; the PCB containing the specific processor &#x2013; may be under development itself. In this case, the embedded software could first be developed as a simulation running on a PC workstation. In the next step, an evaluation board of the platform vendor could be used as long as the device electronics are not available. In the last step, the software is integrated on the final device&#x2019;s electronics.</p>
<p>Each of these targets (simulation, evaluation board, device electronics) can successively be integrated into the Software CI infrastructure. This ensures that the evolving software runs on the available target. However, the different engineering disciplines still need to agree on the implementation of functional requirements, non-functional requirements, safety requirements, interfaces, etc.
Software CI as part of a system development project is important for ensuring the desired software quality over time. However, CI only on the software level does not really address the risk of failing during (final) system integration &#x2013; aka &#x201C;big bang integration&#x201D;.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-integration-on-the-system-level">Continuous integration on the system level</h2>
<p>System CI helps with avoiding such &#x201C;big bang integration&#x201D; effects. It is far from realistic to achieve the continuity of the fast integration cycles of software, e.g., check-in builds, on the system level. However, the principle of continuously integrating parts to a whole applies at the system level as well.
The continuity of software integration is based on the integration of source code parts into the mainline whereas the continuity of system integration is based on the availability of system parts over time, e.g., PCBs, mechanical parts, cables, software functionality, infrastructure, test stands, etc.</p>
<p>The evolution of the System CI is driven by a roughly planned &#x201C;integration vision&#x201D;. This may start as just a sketch on a whiteboard depicting how the successively available system parts might be put together over time. The integration vision is not a detailed plan, but provides guidance for the integration activities on the system level.
The concrete integration of parts is planned and performed as they become available &#x2013; or maybe a short time in advance. The integration itself is performed as simply as possible. For example, a specially developed sophisticated mechanical fixation is not needed if a tape is sufficient to attach one part to another in an early lab model.</p>
<p>System CI is a constant flow of adding parts and replacing parts with, for example, more mature parts or new revisions of parts. The evolving system is the central target of the System CI infrastructure. The infrastructure takes care of, among other things, building the software, deploying it to the integrated system, and automatically testing the realised system functionality.
This allows for regression testing on the system level, which is important in dealing with all the changes on the system integration &#x2013; as software regression testing is important in dealing with all the changes in software development.
The order of particularly meaningful system integration steps needs to be planned, at least roughly. Given a product vision and a draft system architecture, a value-based and risk-based system backlog planning are the basis for successful continuous system integration that lowers the risk of late design breakage and increases the opportunity to develop the right product.</p>
<h2 id="fail-early">Fail early!</h2>
<p>System CI enables us to fail early and thus gives us time to react, change, and test again in fast cycles. Hence, System CI heavily reduces the risk of late design breakage. Additionally, the progress of system development does not have to be deduced or guessed indirectly, but can be demonstrated with the current state of the integrated system &#x2013; at any point in time along the development lifecycle. </p>
<p>Increase the opportunity to develop the right product by applying this in your next systems project!</p>
