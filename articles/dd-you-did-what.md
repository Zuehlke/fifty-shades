### Is it an outsourcing?! Is it a team sourcing?! No! It is the Distributed development!

Dive into Distributed development topic and get all the information needed to kick-start the project in Distributed Development Setup.

### 1. What is it?
Distributed development is a powerful way to realize project research, development, and realization across two or more physical locations. Difference between outsourcing and distributed development is that, in DD setup, all the organization is working together on the same level with a common goal of project realization.

### 2. How does it work?
In the DD setup, there are multiple team members distributed to at least two locations. It's usual that the whole team meets at one location where they would have an opportunity to meet each other in person, meet their Clients, stakeholder and get direct contact with all the key members of the project.

Transparency in the team is one of the most important aspects and the key element of one team feel. All team members should share ideas, experience, information, resources, and decisions.

Team collaboration is internet based which means that it uses online tools for daily work such as Skype, email, Jira, Slack, Whiteboard, Retrium, Trello etc.

Organizational tools are remote and colocated pair programming and knowledge sharing sessions. They help to build the team's knowledge base stronger and boost up their confidence and mutual trust to perform as one team.

### 3. What are the main benefits?
**Scalability** of the team is close to limitless since it is not dependent on one location. **Finding skilled team members** as the best expert for the job **is easier** in DD setup since it creates an access to larger employees pool. On another hand, it helps to **keep in close proximity to the Market and the Customer**. **Cost benefits** are positively affected since it allows a project to hire team members from other locations with **lower rates** but keeping the **same quality** of and desired expertise level.
DD with its distributed locations **increases competitiveness on global market** and allowing companies to fulfill growing market interest. Companies have an opportunity to **meet new people**, travel and **exercise knowledge sharing** through the whole organization.
It also decouples employees and their work from their physical location which means **no location boundaries**. They can do home office or any office (across the whole organization).
Since DD setup is vendor's internal organization process there is **no overhead for Customer**.

### 4. What are the challenges and how to overcome them?
##### Language barrier - bilingual
English, as a common language of communication, is one of the best practices for Distributed development setup. But since it covers global market, most common challenge is the language barrier. This is mostly coming from Customer side which is understandable and realistic. Simply, there are no exclusive conditions that all of the business representatives should know to speak English. This can be solved by using bilingual approach for all shared resources, better plan and facilitate meetings where there are participants that use different language for communication.

##### Different time zones - time management
DD setup can also work with different time zones. Time planning and management is important, so the team can use the time overlaps in the best possible way as the project progresses. This should be considered at the project's earliest phases.

##### On-sight support - proxy
Projects usually provide production on-sight support for Customers. This could have limitations if the team is distributed on locations further from the Customer or in other countries, and also from a legal perspective. This is solved by introducing proxy roles on the side of the team which is closest to the Customer. This role allows the whole team to be involved and contribute to the production support on their project.

##### Cultural differences and Initial mindset/one team feel - collocated kick-off, regular visits, distributed sessions and coffee breaks
If the team is distributed between different countries it is important that they are aware of and understand cultural differences. Also the initial mindset of one team can be challenging to achieve. It is a key to a very successful distributed team. This mindset can be achieved with collocated project kick-off, having regular bidirectional visits, organizing distributed sessions for knowledge share, pair programming, planning, decision making. By doing so, team members can learn about each other, get to know the cultural differences and by understanding them to communicate and perform better as one team.
Also, powerful tools are informal distributed sessions such as distributed coffee break. Yes, it's simple as that: grab a coffee or your beverage of choice, join the group meeting, turn on the camera and have fun - talk about anything you want with your team members :)

### 5. What can you distribute?
Almost any role that doesn't require close proximity to the customer can be distributed. We had experience of distributing roles such as PO, Scrum master, meeting facilitator, software engineer, QA, SD, UX, DevOps, PM, Agile coaches and many more.

### 6. What setup do you need for it?
Internet of course and people :)
Infrastructure is an important aspect that needs to be settled by having dedicated rooms/places for video conference, good headsets, and other video and audio equipment. If properly set, each of your teammates is on a click of a button away.
Team spirit and motivation are to develop as the project progresses but there is nothing better to get the whole team together at one location and define a good new members onboarding plan. Online tools and their preparation (accounts, spaces, licenses etc.) are also important to be set up in earliest phase as possible.

**_After all said and done, if well prepared with the guidelines from above Distributed Development can be a very powerful asset to the company and a very fun and efficient way to do projects._**
