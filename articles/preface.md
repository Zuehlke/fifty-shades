# Preface

I can still remember my early days as a software developer after my studies. I was in the wild years in the middle of the New Economy and I had to get up speed in new projects and acquire the technical knowledge within a very short time. I had to gain a lot of experience myself and learned a lot on the job and unfortunately sometimes also in the hard way. 

Later, as a project manager, I learned a lot on how to collaborate with people and, above all, that cooperation, leadership, working techniques, communication and maintaining relationships, in addition to technology knowledge, are very important. From my experience, projects often fail not because of the technology, but because of unclear or wrong requirements, a lack of willingness to cooperate, sheer complexity but also because the organization is simply overstrained. 

The collection "Machines, Code, People" is a wonderful summary of what I have often experienced myself and what is really important in everyday project work. Code and machines together build a solution. Knowing these technologies is crucial. And to bring real innovation, it is equally important to have the right people on board, to build up a great team and to really understand the needs of the customer. 

This impressive collection was created as a joint effort within the Zühlke Group across all areas and it makes me extremely proud that so many authors have contributed so actively and with a lot of passion. 

I wish you a lot of inspiration and hopefully a lot of insights that you can use in your daily work.
