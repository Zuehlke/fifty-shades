title: Why You Should Create a Paper Prototype - And How to Test it with Your Users
---
# {{page.title}}

At Zühlke, we strive to work in a lean and agile way. We embrace the uncertainty inherent in every new project by starting with a focus on exploring and learning. In interaction design, this can be achieved by creating, testing and iteratively refining a paper prototype. 
 
## Why testing a paper prototype?

Here are the reasons why:

1. Get the design process going quickly. 
2. Getting the interaction design right should be your first priority: navigation, workflow, organisation of content, the terms used to denote domain elements. Simple black-and-white wireframes help you focus on these issues. 
3. Action sequences or scenarios are paramount in interaction design. Creating a paper prototype makes you think about those sequences. Will the user understand how to perform the next step? And if so, how do they navigate back to where they came from?
4. Quickly test the paper prototype to get the most relevant feedback early on. Do the users understand the navigation? Did you get their workflow right? Guess what: sometimes you didn't, but changing those simple wireframes is very easy and you'll be confident that the next iteration is way better than the first.
5. Don't waste your time with details or "realistic" designs unless the interaction basics have been validated using a test with real users. This doesn’t mean that visual design is unimportant, but it comes in at a later stage.
6. Involve your stakeholders into design and evaluation of the paper prototype. Create sketches together with the stakeholders at the whiteboard or using the "design studio" method. Have your stakeholders observe the user tests. Let them experience firsthand what fast and repeated cycles of "build-measure-learn" can achieve.

## How to create a paper prototype

1. Select one or more scenarios that you would like to test.
2. Write an instruction sheet that asks the users to perform the tasks associated with the selected scenarios.
3. Create a set of wireframes, either directly on paper or using a low fidelity wireframing tool like Balsamiq. Make sure to include all intermediate steps to your wireframes that a user would go through when performing the tasks.
4. If one step involves adding a dialog on top of an existing page, create a wireframe "snippet" that just shows the dialog. 
5. Your final result is a stack of sketched or printed screens and a collection of snippets.

## Recruiting test participants

Your test participants should be representative of the "real" users of your system under design. If the future users of your system need some kind of domain knowledge, make sure your participants have this knowledge. For a typical early-stage paper prototyping test, five representative users are enough to find the most important issues in your design. 

## How to test a paper prototype

The goal of the test is to observe your users performing the selected scenarios by simulating the intended usage with the paper prototype. It's very much like a regular usability test, just without a computer.

Ideally you have one person helping you conduct the test. One of you "plays the computer" and prompts the participant. The other person observes and takes notes. It's a good idea to ask a customer representative to be the note taker or at least to be present and observe the test. This is invaluable to help creating a shared understanding of the design under test. 

Explain to the participant that you're testing the design, not them. If they get stuck or fail to understand something, it's a valuable indication of a problem with the wireframes that will be used to improve them.

Tell the participant to read the tasks from the task sheet and to perform them in the specified order. Ask them to "use" the wireframes as if they were a real interactive user interface. Finally, ask the participant to "think aloud", i.e. to verbalise their thinking while they interact with the prototype. Since this behaviour is somewhat unnatural, most people need to be reminded of it from time to time during the test.

Never explain how to use the prototype. Resist the urge to help the participant if they're stuck. The participant's failure to complete a step in the workflow is one of the most important signals to collect during such a test. Use this opportunity to explore their mental model by asking "What did you expect?" or "What would you like to do now?" or even just "Why?" to get a deeper understanding what's going on.

Only if the participant has been unable to proceed for at least a minute or so, it's OK to point out how the task was meant to be performed in the prototype.

Take notes of everything that happens during the test. Pro-tip: use one post-it note for each observation to ease the structuring of the observations. 

After the test, ask the participant to share any observation, opinion or suggestion. It's ok to discuss solution ideas at this point.

# How to evaluate the test

When the participant has left, discuss the session with all observers to create a shared understanding of what just happened. Which were the three main points to take away from it? 

After the sessions are finished, make sense of all your observations by clustering them. Then name and prioritise the clusters. Don't be too formal about this - the most important issues in your prototype will be obvious to all observers by now. 

Each named cluster of observations is a topic that needs to be addressed in your interaction design. So now go ahead and create the next iteration of your paper prototype. Rinse. Repeat.
