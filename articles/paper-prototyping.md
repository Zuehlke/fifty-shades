title: Why You Should Create a Paper Prototype - And How to Test it with Your Users
---
# {{page.title}}

At Zühlke, we strive to work in a lean and agile way. We embrace the uncertainty inherent in every new project by starting with a focus on exploring and learning. 

Every UX professional will agree to this - iterations are a central tenet of User Centered Design, after all. But in reality, many UX designers will start building an interactive prototype even on the first design iteration.

In our opinion, this approach does not lead to the best and fastest possible learning results. We suggest instead to start the design by creating and testing a paper prototype. 
 
## Why testing a paper prototype?

Here are the reasons why:

1. Quickly putting down your first ideas in a series of simple wireframe sketches will get the design process going. 
2. To ensure high usability, getting the interaction design right should be your first priority: navigation, workflow, organisation of content, the terms used to denote domain elements. Simple black-and-white wireframes help you focus on these issues. 
3. Action sequences or scenarios are the most important kind of user requirement with respect to interaction design. Creating a paper prototype makes you think about those sequences. Will the user understand how to perform the next step? And if so, how doe they navigate back to where she came from?
4. Quickly test the paper prototype to get the kind of feedback that is most relevant in the early stages of interaction design. Do the users understand the navigation? Did you get their workflow right? Guess what: sometimes you didn't, but changing those simple wireframes is very easy and you'll be confident that the next iteration is way better than the first.
5. Don't waste your time with details or "realistic" designs unless the interaction basics have been validated using a test with real users. This doesn’t mean that visual design is unimportant or just about making the existing UI pretty - it’s an additional design iteration, but one that is meant to build on the groundwork laid by the early interaction design.
6. Involve your stakeholders into design and evaluation of the paper prototype. Create sketches together with the stakeholders at the whiteboard or using the "design studio" method. Have your stakeholders observe the user tests. Your project and your credibility as a UX professional will benefit if you invite your stakeholders to collaborate in all aspects of the design process. Doing this also demonstrates early on what fast and repeated cycles of "build-measure-learn" can achieve.

## How to create a paper prototype

So you created a set of wireframes, maybe on paper, maybe using a low fidelity wireframing tool like Balsamiq. What are the steps you have to take to test your paper prototype with real users?

The goal of the test is to observe your users performing the selected scenarios by simulating the intended usage with the paper prototype. It's very much like a regular usability test, just without a computer. Here is a minimal set of steps required to prepare a user test with a paper prototype:

1. Select one or more scenarios that you would like to test.
2. Write an instruction sheet that asks the users to perform the tasks associated with the selected scenarios.
3. Since you used those scenarios for designing your wireframes, most of the content should already be there. You now have to add all the intermediate steps to your wireframes that a user would go through when performing the scenarios. Sometimes that means you have to create additional screens.
4. Very often, you need to visualise intermediate states that only affect a small part of a screen, e.g. when a dialog is layered on top of an existing screen. In such a case, it's often best to create a wireframe "snippet" that just shows the dialog. It takes some experience to strike the balance between "a stack of 100 screens" and "one screen and 2000 snippets". Ultimately, you'll need to be able to manage your screens and snippets during the user test.

## Recruiting test participants
Your test participants should be representative of the "real" users of your system under design. If the future users of your system need some kind of domain knowledge, make sure your participants have this knowledge. 

For a typical early-stage paper prototyping test, five representative users are enough to find the most important problems in your design. 

## How to test a paper prototype

This is the fun part.

Ideally you have one person helping you conduct the test. One of you "plays the computer" and prompts the participant. The other person observes and takes notes. It's a good idea to ask a customer representative to be the note taker. If that is not an option, you should insist that they have to observe the test firsthand. This is invaluable to help creating a shared understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the design under test. 

At the outset, explain to the participant that you're testing the design of a planned interactive system, not them. If they get stuck or fail to understand something, it's an indication of a problem with the wireframes that will be used to improve the design.

Tell the participant to read the tasks from the task sheet and to perform them in the specified order. Ask them to "use" the wireframes as if they were a real interactive user interface. Finally, ask the participant to "think aloud", i.e. to verbalise their thinking while they interact with the prototype. Since this behaviour is somewhat unnatural, most people need to be reminded of it from time to time during the test.

Never explain how to use the prototype. Resist the urge to help the participant if they're stuck. The participant's failure to complete a step in the workflow is one of the most important signals to collect during such a test. Use this opportunity to explore their mental model by asking "What did you expect?" This is the single best question to use during a usability test, by the way. You can also ask "What would you like to do now?" and it always help to ask "Why?" to get a deeper understanding of the participant's mental model.

Only if the participant has been unable to proceed for at least a minute or so, it's OK to point out how the task was meant to be performed in the prototype.

Take notes of everything that happens during the test.

After the test, ask the participant to share any observation, opinion or suggestion. It's ok to discuss solution ideas at this point.
